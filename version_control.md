To clone the Git repository and work on the "develop" branch locally, and then later introduce your changes to the team's "develop" branch, you can follow these steps using Git commands:

### Cloning the Repository and Working on the "develop" Branch:

1. Clone the repository to your local PC:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

3. Switch to the "develop" branch (assuming it exists):
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   ```

4. Create and switch to a new branch for your work (replace `<branch_name>` with a suitable branch name):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <branch_name>
   ```

5. Make your changes to the project, including the new function.

6. Stage your changes for commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

7. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new function and other improvements"
   ```

8. Push your changes to your fork or branch on the remote repository (replace `<branch_name>` with your branch name and `<remote>` with the remote repository name, often "origin" by default):
   ```bash
   git push <remote> <branch_name>
   ```

### Introducing Changes to the Team's "develop" Branch:

1. Create a pull request (PR) on the remote repository's website (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) from your branch to the team's "develop" branch. Include a description of your changes.

2. Wait for one or several team members to review your changes and provide feedback.

3. Address any feedback and make necessary modifications to your branch.

4. Push the changes to your branch again:
   ```bash
   git push <remote> <branch_name>
   ```

5. Inform the team that you have updated your PR.

6. Once your changes are approved by the team and any continuous integration checks pass, the team lead or repository owner can merge your changes into the "develop" branch.

7. After the merge, you can update your local "develop" branch with the latest changes from the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull <remote> develop
   ```

This process allows you to clone the repository, work on your feature branch, and contribute your changes to the team's "develop" branch through a pull request, ensuring that your code is reviewed and tested by the team before being merged into the main development branch.
