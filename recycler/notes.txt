reg = LinearRegression() Use the test set to predict the output after training.

# Load the data. Follow the below steps to accomplish your task: ...

train = pd.read_csv('train.csv')

test = pd.read_csv('test.csv') # Fit (train) model.

reg.fit(X_train, y_train) # Predict.

accuracy = reg.socre(X_test, y_test)



=====================================

To accomplish the given task, you can follow these steps:

1. Read and preprocess the data:
   - Read the training datasets (A), test dataset (B), and ideal functions dataset (C) in CSV format.
   - Preprocess the data by extracting the x and y values from each dataset.

2. Choose the four best-fit ideal functions:
   - Calculate the sum of squared deviations for each of the 50 ideal functions using the training datasets.
   - Select the four ideal functions with the lowest sum of squared deviations.

3. Map test data to the chosen ideal functions:
   - Iterate through each x-y pair in the test dataset.
   - For each pair, calculate the regression for all four chosen ideal functions.
   - Check if the maximum deviation of the calculated regression exceeds the largest deviation between the training dataset and the corresponding ideal function by more than a factor of sqrt(2).
   - If the deviation is within the allowed range, execute the mapping and save the result along with the deviation.

4. Visualize the data:
   - Use suitable plotting libraries in Python, such as Matplotlib or Seaborn, to create visualizations.
   - Visualize the training datasets, test dataset, chosen ideal functions, and mapped results.
   - Ensure the visualizations provide a clear and logical representation of the data.

5. Create suitable unit tests:
   - Identify critical parts of your code, such as the calculation of sum of squared deviations and mapping of test data.
   - Write unit tests using a testing framework like unittest or pytest to validate the correctness of these components.
   - Cover different scenarios and edge cases to ensure the program behaves as expected.

Remember to document your code properly, including comments and docstrings, and cite any external sources you use for research.
